Install JUDI
============

   :description lang=en: Get started by installing JUDI.


JUDI is implemented as a python package and can be installed using the *pip* installer. JUDI depends
on python package *pydoit* whose latest versions work with python 3.4 and above. Hence, it is
recommended that python 3.4 or above is already installed on the system. JUDI also depends on *pandas*.
JUDI has been tested using python 3.6 on Linux based systems.


Assuming you have Python and pandas already, `install judi`_:

.. prompt:: bash $

    pip install doit
    pip install judi
