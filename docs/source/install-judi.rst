   :description lang=en: Get started creating software pipelines using JUDI.


JUDI is implemented as a python package and can be installed using *pip* installer. JUDI depends
on python package *pydoit* whose latest versions work with python 3.4 and above. Hence, it is
recommended that python 3.4 or above is already installed on the system. JUDI has been tested
using python 3.6 on linux based systems.

Quick start
-----------

Assuming you have Python already, `install judi`_:

.. prompt:: bash $

    pip install doit
    pip install judi
