More DoIt Features
==================

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: More advanced features of DoIt.


JUDI is implemented using the class example given at the `blog <http://blog.schettino72.net/posts/doit-task-creation.html>`_ 
maintained by the creator of DoIt.

JUDI changes only the way the DoIt tasks are created, the rest of the features of DoIt such as execution etc. are kept unchanged in JUDI.
We would like to encourage you to explore other features of DoIt described `here <http://pydoit.org/contents.html>`_.

Some recommended features are:
  * `verbosity <http://pydoit.org/tasks.html#verbosity>`_
  * `task info <http://pydoit.org/cmd_other.html#info>`_
  * `uptodate <http://pydoit.org/dependencies.html#uptodate>`_
  * etc.
